#PFA_2018_GP1
This project is the final project I made within a month in my first year at ISART Digital Montreal. The goal was to make a video game from scratch by making our own game engine from scratch using OpenGL. I ending up being alone in this project (instead of 4), therefore I prefered to make it a technical demo by adding multiples light rendering, textures, normal maps and height maps calculation to give a more realistic render.

Some basic game behavior were added to make it an FPS by having a gun who is able to shoot bullets. You can shoot bullets by pressing F key and looking somewhere in 3D space. The gun is not attached to anything, therefore it will not follow you. Also the bullets size, trajectory and velocity are not reliable.

As time was going I managed to make a Sound dll using irrklang library and wrapping it to make it usable everywhere without having to manage irrklang objects.
